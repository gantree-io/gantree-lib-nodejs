## About

Substrate is built on the core belief that the future will be multi-chain.

In the past, setting up and managing blockchain networks required an understanding of a multitude of concepts which may have inhibited end users from experimenting with them.

With the assistance of funding from the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), Flex Dapps is building a suite of technologies which will enable both power users and those less versed to create and manage substrate-powered parachain networks via rapid spin-up and tear-down of self-managed or cloud-hosted machines.

## Docker Image

If you would rather install dependencies automatically in a container, a Docker image is available here:

- [Docker image](https://github.com/flex-dapps/gantree-cli-docker).

## Requirements

### 1 - Application Requirements

When installed locally, Gantree-lib requires the following application dependencies:

### 2 - Ansible Requirements

Install required ansible roles

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gantree-io/gantree-requirements/master/ansible-galaxy/requirements.yml > ansible_requirements.yml
ansible-galaxy install -r ansible_requirements.yml
```

### 3 - Python Requirements

**_Please note:_** _It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment such as *pipenv* or *venv*_

Install required python packages

```bash
pip install ansible boto boto3 botocore requests google-auth
```

### 4 - Package Installation

Install gantree-lib

```bash
npm install gantree-lib -g
```

### 5 - Environment Requirements

#### Provider Credentials

For security reasons, credentials for infrastructure providers must be exported as environment variables.

| PROVIDER     | EXPORTS REQUIRED                                | NOTES                                                                                                                                                       |

## Gantree Configuration

Gantree requires a configuration file (Gantree configuration) in order to guide creation, provisioning, modification and deletion of instances.

In essence, your Gantree configuration represents your desired infrastructure.

When creating your own Gantree configuration, it's **recommended to create it based on one of the samples provided**.

If your configuration is invalid, Gantree will try it's best to help you identify where misconfiguration has occurred.

Once you're ready to create your own Gantree configuration, please consult the links below.
